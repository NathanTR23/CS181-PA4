  This project includes an employee class that holds the name, hourly pay, and hours worked of an employee, and has functions to return the employee's total pay and name.
It also has a manager class that is derived from the employee class and includes an extra variable to hold a bonus for managers. This class redefines the employee function
to calculate pay so that the calculation includes the manager's bonus.
  The main program uses the manager class to calculate the highest paid manager and average pay of a number of managers based on user input.
The user is prompted to enter the number of managers, then the name, hourly pay, hours worked, and bonus for each manager.
